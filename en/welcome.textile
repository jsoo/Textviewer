h1. Welcome to TextViewer

The source file for this page is an ordinary Textile 2.2 file. If you're viewing 
 this in TextViewer, you can see what the source looks like by clicking the 
 "source" link in the menu bar.

The only TextViewer-specific part of the file is the Textile comment block at
 the top. This is optional; it allows you to assign some metadata to the file. 
 Currently TextViewer understands two items:
 
; page_title
: Value for @$tv->page_title@. Useful for @<title>@, in a menu, etc.
; sort_order
: How @$tv->source_files@ is sorted: useful for sorting pages in a menu

Otherwise TextViewer uses the file name for both the title and sort value.
