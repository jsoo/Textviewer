h1. Welcome to TextViewer

TextViewer is a simple web viewer for text files. To install it, you upload the files to a web server. To use it, you write documents in a simplified markup language such as "Textile":http://textileit.com/, and drop them in a folder on the web server. That's it -- you now have a website.

Your TextViewer website includes a simple navigation menu, automatically updated
 when you add or remove a document. If you translate one or more documents into
 another language, TextViewer automatically adds a language switcher. For 
 documents you haven't translated yet, TextViewer will display the version in 
 the default language.

The source file for this page is an ordinary Textile 2.2 file. If you're viewing 
 this in TextViewer, you can see what the source looks like by clicking the 
 "source" link in the menu bar.

The only TextViewer-specific part of the file is the Textile comment block at
 the top. This is optional; it allows you to assign some metadata to the file. 
 Currently TextViewer understands two items:
 
; page_title
: Value for @$tv->page_title@. Useful for @<title>@, in a menu, etc.
; sort_order
: How @$tv->source_files@ is sorted: useful for sorting pages in a menu

Otherwise TextViewer uses the file name for both the title and sort value.
