h1. Managing Content in TextViewer

Simply drop files into the root-level directory matching the default language (e.g., @/en@ for English). 

h2. Translations

To add a translation, add a root-level directory named for the new language
 (using the two-letter or four-letter ISO code). You can either copy all files
 from the default language directory or add them one at a time. If you keep
 the same file names, TextViewer can show the corresponding file from the
 default language when there is a missing file.
