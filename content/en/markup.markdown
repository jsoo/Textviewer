# Markup Languages #

TextViewer offers a choice of markup languages:

* [Textile](http://textileit.com/)
* [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
	* [Markdown Extra](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/)

This is an example Markdown page. Basic "SmartyPants" post-filtering for 
Markdown is enabled by default. Set your preferred SmartyPants options,
and choice of Markdown vs. Markdown Extra, in TextViewer's config file.

Textile applies "smart" typography by default, so the SmartyPants setting has
no effect on Textile documents.

Give each document a file extension matching the language:

* Textile: `.textile`
* Markdown: `.markdown`

You can include both file types in one TextViewer project.
